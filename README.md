2. Connect iPhone with cable
3. Click on iPhone icon in iTunes
4. Under "Backups" section:
   - Select "This computer"
   - Check "Encrypt local backup"
   - Click "Back Up Now"
5. Wait for backup completion (10-30 minutes)
```

### Method 2: Using Command Line
```
# Open Command Prompt as Administrator
cd "%APPDATA%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup"
dir
# Note the folder name (this is your backup ID)
```

## üöÄ Running the Analysis

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Navigate to script folder
cd C:\SpywareDetection\

# Run analysis on iTunes backup
python spyware_detector.py --backup "%APPDATA%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\[BACKUP-ID]"

# Example with actual backup ID
python spyware_detector.py --backup "%APPDATA%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef"
```

### Finding Your Backup Location
```bash
# List all backups
dir "%APPDATA%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup"

# Each folder represents one device backup
# Use the most recent folder for your target device
```

### Advanced Usage with Diagnostic Files
```bash
# If you have diagnostic files from iPhone
python spyware_detector.py --backup "[BACKUP-PATH]" --diagnostic "[DIAGNOSTIC-PATH]"
```
