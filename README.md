# Run analysis on an iTunes backup
python spyware_detector.py --backup "%APPDATA%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\[BACKUP-ID]"

# Advanced analysis with diagnostic logs
python spyware_detector.py --backup "[BACKUP-PATH]" --diagnostic "[DIAGNOSTIC-PATH]"
```

### Creating an iTunes Backup
1. Connect your iPhone to your computer
2. Open iTunes and select your device
3. Choose "Back up to this computer"
4. Enable "Encrypt local backup" for full access

dir "%APPDATA%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup"
```

## üìä Understanding Results

### Risk Assessment Scale
- **üî¥ CRITICAL (20+ points)**: Device is likely compromised
- **üü† HIGH (10-19 points)**: Suspicious indicators detected
- **üü° MEDIUM (5-9 points)**: Minor anomalies present
- **üü¢ LOW (0-4 points)**: No significant threats detected

### Detection Methodology
- **IOC Matching**: Comparison against known Indicators of Compromise
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identification of abnormal system behavior
- **Heuristic Scanning**: Detection of suspicious patterns
- **Forensic Analysis**: In-depth examination of system artifacts

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Local Analysis**: All scanning is performed locally on your computer
- **No Data Transmission**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Secure Reporting**: Reports are saved locally with optional encryption

### Legal Compliance
- **Authorization Required**: Only scan devices you own or have explicit permission to analyze
- **Corporate Policy**: Business devices may require IT department approval
- **Privacy Laws**: Respect applicable privacy and data protection regulations

## üß∞ Advanced Features

### Focused Spyware Detection
For targeted Pegasus spyware detection only:
```bash
python AdvancedSpywareDetector.py --backup "[BACKUP-PATH]"
```

### Command Line Options
```
--backup        Path to iTunes backup directory
--diagnostic    Path to iOS diagnostic files
--report        Custom path for report output
--quiet         Suppress console output (results still saved to file)
--json-only     Output only JSON data (for programmatic use)
```

## üìö Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backup Access Problems
```
- Ensure iTunes is closed during analysis
- Check backup encryption password is correct
- Verify backup location exists
```

#### Python Errors
```
- Verify Python 3.7+ is installed: python --version
- Check all dependencies are installed: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run as Administrator if needed for full system access
```
